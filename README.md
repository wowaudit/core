# World of Warcraft Audit

This is the back-end scraper engine that generates JSON files for the World of Warcraft Audit Spreadsheet,
found at https://wowaudit.com. The code is open-source and while it's possible for you to play around with,
it's not built with individual use in mind. Therefore, setting up the scripts can be difficult.

## Getting Started

This project currently is not set up for use by others. I hope to revamp it and make this possible soon.
